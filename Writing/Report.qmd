## Overview

Using objects and classes in python is a great way to encapsulate both data and functionality, while being easy to implement and use. Larger implementations via object oriented programming may require subclass hierarchies with large depth and breadth. This experiment tests how depth and breadth of subclassing can affect running time of a program. The tool calculates the areas of different shapes via different subclasses and measures the time to run throughout to measure the effect of subclass layer depth. 

## Implementation

## Data 

### Horizontal Subclasses

| Class | Iterations | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 |
|:-----:|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|       |            | []    | []    | []    |
|       |            | []    | []    | []    |
|       |            | []    | []    | []    |

### Verticle Subclasses

| Class | Level | Iterations | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 |
|:-----:|:-----:|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|       |       |            | []    | []    | []    |
|       |       |            | []    | []    | []    |
|       |       |            | []    | []    | []    |
