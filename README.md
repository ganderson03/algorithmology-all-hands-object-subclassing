## RQ: How is runtime performance affected by subclass inheritances that perform mathematical operations on lists containing int and float type values.

# Scope: 
Inheritance depth: 1 superclass and 9 nested subclasses (total 10)

Mathematical operations: Addition, Multiplication, and Exponentiation

Data structures: Lists containing randomly set values, being floats and integers

Metered by: runtime in reference to time to complete operations
